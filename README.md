## Overview

The AI Messenger App is a modern chat application that combines real-time messaging with intelligent AI features such as smart replies, language translation, and content moderation. Built for scalability and security, it leverages microservices, WebSockets, and advanced NLP models to deliver a seamless communication experience for users and teams[5][6][7].

---

## Features

- **Real-Time Messaging:** Instant chat using WebSockets for live communication.
- **AI-Powered Replies:** Context-aware smart suggestions powered by LLMs (e.g., Llama 3, OpenAI).
- **Language Translation:** Automatic translation for multilingual conversations.
- **Content Moderation:** Automated detection and filtering of inappropriate content.
- **Voice-to-Text:** Convert speech to text in real time.
- **User Authentication:** Secure login with JWT and OAuth 2.0.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Microservices, sharded databases, and edge caching.
- **Responsive UI:** Built with React and Next.js for optimal performance and accessibility.

---

## Architecture

The system is composed of several microservices and components:

- **Frontend:** Next.js (React, TypeScript)
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express), Python (for AI/NLP services)
- **Real-Time Layer:** WebSockets with Redis Pub/Sub or Kafka
- **Databases:** MongoDB (messages), PostgreSQL (users), Vector DB (AI context)
- **AI Services:** Integrated with LLM APIs, translation, and moderation models
- **Cloud & DevOps:** Docker, Kubernetes, AWS/Azure, Terraform

**High-Level Flow:**
1. Clients connect via WebSocket for real-time messaging.
2. API Gateway manages authentication and routing.
3. Chat Service handles message delivery and history.
4. AI Service processes messages for smart replies and moderation.
5. Databases store user data, chat history, and AI vectors.
6. Notifications and file storage handled via cloud services.
